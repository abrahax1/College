I decided to make chess the focus of my website because I enjoy playing the game, and I aimed to develop a well-designed website that would engage and captivate visitors.

### To visualise the website:
1. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser (I used Chrome)

### What can you expect:
- Home page - Where everything is: 
    - Logo 
    - Gradient with animation (created with css, js)
    - Scroll Animation (css, js)
    - Carousel (css, js)
    - Embedded video
    - Image Animations (css, js)
    - Circle Images (css)

- Objectives 
    - Extra information on the objectives 

- Pieces 
    - Extra information on the Pieces

- Openings 
    - The same video used in the 'Home' screen

- My Improvements
    - Striped Table 1: containing the improvements I added to the original website with references (and some images)
    - Striped Table 2: containing the references for the images used
